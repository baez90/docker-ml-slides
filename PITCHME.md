## Agenda

- Motivation
- Classic job scheduling systems - Slurm
- Comparison criteria

## Motivation

- Docker containers are omnipresent
- Are Docker containers also useful for ML and Big Data processing? |
- Is it possible to use current Docker cluster management systems for job scheduling in multi-user environments? |
- Is it possible to use one or multiple GPUs to increase the performance? |
- Is it possible to run multiple jobs in parallel without them interfering with each other? |
